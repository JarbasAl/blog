## Leading OpenVoiceOS and HiveMind

I am currently the lead developer for two significant projects:

- [OpenVoiceOS](https://openvoiceos.org/) - Leading development efforts for OpenVoiceOS, a non-profit organization creating frameworks for voice-enabling various applications and devices. This project aims to empower voice technology and make it accessible to everyone.
- [HiveMind](https://github.com/JarbasHiveMind/)- Serving as the lead developer for HiveMind, a protocol designed to connect multiple voice assistants and enable seamless collaboration between them. HiveMind represents the future of voice technology interconnectivity.

# Professional Experience Highlights

I embarked on a journey as a self-employed Software Engineer since January 2017. This freelance role has allowed me to specialize in the voice assistant space, working remotely from Portugal. 
I have had the privilege of working in various capacities that have honed my skills as a software engineer and open-source developer.

My journey started as a Software Engineer at XERLOK (based in Argentina). Here, I led the development of the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) for an emotional smart assistant. My responsibilities included selecting reference hardware, creating a reference Raspberry Pi image, developing a local web UI, implementing basic vision capabilities like face tracking and emotion recognition, and building a basic speaker recognition system using Gaussian Mixture Models. I also assisted in the automatic translation of NLP resources into Spanish

Other of my recent roles has been as a Software Engineer at [NEONGECKO.COM INC](http://neon.ai/), (Mycroft Channel Partners) where I've been involved in voice assistant Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) projects since 2019.

A significant chapter in my career was spent at [Chatterbox](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/hellochatterbox/chatterbox-the-smart-speaker-that-kids-build-and-p), where I was the co-founder and served as a Full Stack Engineer from May 2018 to November 2021. During my tenure, I successfully developed the full stack for a privacy-respecting educational smart assistant that kids build and teach themselves. My accomplishments included overseeing a succesfull Kickstarter campaign, creating a versatile library for voice assistant creation, and developing a proprietary voice assistant stack. I also worked on creating a intuitive React + Blockly-based UI that kids use to build skills

I remain actively engaged in projects like OpenVoiceOS and HiveMind, continuing to contribute and innovate in the voice technology domain.
