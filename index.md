# Hello

I'm Miro, this is my blog and I write about the things I create

I'm a passionate software engineer and open-source developer with extensive experience in voice assistant technologies. 
My journey has taken me across different countries and roles, and I have a strong focus on contributing to the open-source community.

I am currently the lead developer for two significant projects and most posts will be related to these:

- [OpenVoiceOS](https://openvoiceos.org/) - Leading development efforts for OpenVoiceOS, a non-profit organization creating frameworks for voice-enabling various applications and devices. This project aims to empower voice technology and make it accessible to everyone.
- [HiveMind](https://github.com/JarbasHiveMind/)- Serving as the lead developer for HiveMind, a protocol designed to connect multiple voice assistants and enable seamless collaboration between them. HiveMind represents the future of voice technology interconnectivity.
